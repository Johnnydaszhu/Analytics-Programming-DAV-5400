    "Suppose you have ridden a bicycle from New York City to Key West, Florida. Your bicycle odometer shows the total miles you have travelled thus far, which you make a note of each day with paper and pencil. Your first two entries might be ‘55’ and ‘120’, indicating that you rode your bike 55 miles on day 1 and 65 miles on day 2. Your task is to create a NumPy array wherein you can record the **cumulative miles** you recorded each day during your trip. Then use your Python skills to show the total miles that you rode each day. Assume the trip took a total of 35 days and included at least 4 non-consecutive days where no cycling was possible due to either weather conditions or personal fatigue/soreness. For the **remaining 31 days**, you would have covered the entire distance between NYC and Key West. Complete your work within your Jupyter Notebook for this assignment and be sure to include a writeup explaining your approach to this problem, including the ways in which you decided to make use of NumPy."
