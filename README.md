### Main Takeaway

- [x] Write programs to clean, filter, aggregate, restructure, and combine data.
- [x] Load data from both structured and unstructured sources.
- [x] Perform basic exploratory data analysis.
- [x] Apply principles of scientific method and reproducible reporting to the development
and presentation of code-based solutions.

### Final Project: College Admission Analysis 

Explore the relationship mainly between University Admission Rate and SAT Score but with different condition.
The Dataset were collected under two method:
- [College Scorecard Data(CSV file)](https://api.census.gov/data/2017/)
- [States Population & Income Data(Website API)](https://api.census.gov/data/2017/)
